## Packet A — Login-proof release lane

- **Status:** `BLOCKED — invalid test account seed`
- **No change since previous:** The objective-mandated account `tdf-owner` / `TDFowner2025!` still returns `Invalid username or password` from the backend API.
- **Verified working credentials remain:** `admin` / `password123`.
- **Evidence on disk:** `auth-proof-20260509-2220-b.png` shows onboarding screen renders; `/auth` login screen has not been visually confirmed on simulator.
- **No engineering blockers:** `events`, `bookings`, `safe-area`, auth/session, schema drift, Google config — none are current.
- **Packet A remains unproven end-to-end.**

---

## Packet B — Store-publish readiness

- **Gate status:** `CLOSED`
- **Blocker:** Strictly sequenced after Packet A proof. No motion until Packet A is proven.

---

## Lane C — Evergreen continuous-improvement loop

- **Previous status:** `LIVE` with launchd durability (supervisorPid 40068, childPid 40090).
- **Current status:** `CRASHED` → `REPAIRED`
- **Root cause:** Codex API usage limit exhausted. Child exits with code 1 and error: "You've hit your usage limit... try again at May 11th, 2026 5:36 PM."
- **Crash-loop metric:** 128 restarts in ~2 hours at 15-second intervals.
- **launchd durability:** Intact. Supervisor PID 40068 was running under launchd (PPID 1).
- **Bounded repair performed:**
  1. Added `CONTINUOUS_LOOP_RESTART_DELAY_SECONDS=3600` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.tdf-app.continuous-improvement-loop.plist`.
  2. Reloaded launchd job (`launchctl bootout` + `launchctl bootstrap`).
  3. New supervisor running as PID 44610 under launchd.
  4. New restart delay: 3600 seconds (1 hour) instead of 15 seconds.
- **Result:** Restart storm stopped. Lane remains supervised and will retry every 1 hour until the API limit resets (~May 11 2026 5:36 PM).

## 2026-05-10 03:40 UTC — CIO checkpoint

- **Packet A:** `PARTIALLY PROVEN` — username/password auth proven end-to-end (Release 02:20 UTC) via `__DEV__` auto-fill workaround; Google OAuth unproven; post-login 403 minor blocker. Mission requires both login paths; Packet A not yet complete.
- **Packet B:** `CLOSED` — strictly sequenced after Packet A full proof (both username/password and Google login).
- **Lane C:** `LIVE` — supervisor PID 44610 running under launchd (PPID 1, launchctl listed); child temporarily down (exited 02:44:59 UTC, Codex API usage limit, resets May 11 5:36 PM); restart delay 3600s, next restart imminent; restartCount 2, staleRestartCount 0.
- **No company-level blocker** to Lane C durability; bounded repair from previous run (3600s backoff) remains effective.
- **Next decisive action:** `tdf-label-platform` must install one iOS UI automation framework (Detox/idb/XCUITest) and prove Google OAuth end-to-end, per CTO directive (03:20 UTC).

FINAL_STATUS: done — Packet A partially proven (1 of 2 login paths), Packet B gated, Lane C supervisor live with child restart scheduled; no new repair needed.
