# Staging verification record

Date: 2026-08-13

Environment tested: local isolated worktree and disposable PostgreSQL 16 containers.

Staging deployment: **not performed**. Provider sandbox transaction: **not performed**. DDEX partner
sandbox delivery: **not performed**. No credentials or real customer/royalty data were used.

## Local evidence

The final command transcript is summarized here after the branch-wide verification run:

| Area | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Service phase 0 migration | `./scripts/test-service-storefront-phase0-migration.sh` | Pass: forward, constraints, rollback, reapply |
| Checkout core migration | `./scripts/test-unified-checkout-migration.sh` | Pass: dry-run, rollback, binding, inbox, hold, ledger |
| Service checkout runtime migration | `./scripts/test-service-storefront-checkout-runtime-migration.sh` | Pass: rerun, pre-use rollback, legacy classification, one checkout link, one succeeded attempt, reconciliation deduplication, manual evidence and receipt constraints; rollback correctly refused after a live link |
| Distribution accounting migration | `./scripts/test-distribution-accounting-migration.sh` | Pass: rollback, lifecycle, splits, package/evidence, royalty, separation of duties, payout gates |
| Versioned revenue products | `./scripts/test-versioned-revenue-products-migration.sh` | Pass: inactive legacy Domo rate, approval/immutability, production flag |
| Distribution pricing seeds | `./scripts/test-distribution-product-seeds-migration.sh` | Pass: 14 inactive bilingual seeds, activation/mutation/rollback gates |
| Backend focused tests | Stack-built `tdf-hq-test --match …` | Pass: 50 examples, including 800 property cases, zero failures |
| Backend build | `stack build --fast` at the backend implementation head | Pass; later default/fast rebuilds were stopped after flag churn, not a compiler failure |
| Web regression/accessibility | Jest: five changed suites | Pass: 16 tests, zero failures |
| Web type safety | `npm run typecheck` | Pass |
| Web production build | `npm run build` | Pass: 12,382 modules; bundle/secret gate 5 preloads and 399,972 gzip bytes |
| Release/CI contracts | `npm run test:production-release`; `npm run test:ci-pipeline` | Pass: 21 + 12 tests |
| Registered production batch | Render preflight; apply twice; schema verification against PostgreSQL 17 | Pass: 21/21 migrations, second run idempotent |
| Mobile type safety | `npm --prefix tdf-mobile run typecheck` | Not valid locally: submodule dependencies are absent; CI must install and run it |

The focused backend groups were: service storefront (5), checkout state machine (6), distribution
state machine (5), DDEX intake truthfulness (3), ERN parser (20), and business rules (11). A first
web run performed concurrently with GHC compilation had one 5-second timeout; the exact five-suite
command was rerun without contention and all 16 tests passed. No assertion failed in the timed-out
run.

Follow-up verification for the service checkout runtime passed 10 focused examples, including 200
property cases, with zero failures. `stack test --no-run-tests --fast` compiled both the executable
and test suite after the runtime integration. This is local database/application evidence only: no
Datafast or PayPal sandbox request was made and no provider success was asserted.

## Required staging exercise

1. Restore an anonymized database snapshot and run all migration preflight/apply/verification steps;
   record row counts, conflicts and the `legacy_unreconciled` report. Do not infer payment status.
2. Install provider sandbox secrets through the secret manager; verify redaction and kill switches.
3. Exercise duplicate create/callback/capture, signature failure, reordered/delayed events, declined,
   abandoned, outage and full/partial refund paths. Reconcile provider/internal/ledger totals to zero
   unexplained variance.
4. Exercise private asset upload/download authorization, checksum mismatch, malware quarantine,
   expiry, retention and restore.
5. With a named partner profile, generate and validate one TDF-owned test package, send only to its
   sandbox under separate authorization, preserve transport/acknowledgement evidence, and confirm
   that sandbox evidence cannot transition production rows.
6. Ingest a licensed/non-sensitive report fixture, reconcile totals, create a draft statement and a
   correction. Do not issue or pay it.
7. Run accessibility/responsive/browser E2E, bundle secret scan, log-redaction assertions, alerts and
   every operator tabletop in `operator-runbooks.md`.

No screenshots are attached because the changed pages have not been deployed to a review/staging
URL. Local component and accessibility tests are evidence of rendering behavior, not staging proof.
